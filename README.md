## Description

This web app is a playable card game that allows users to collect and upgrade
cards, construct a deck, and compete in various game modes. Inspired by the
Final Fantasy VIII [minigame](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Triple_Triad)
called Triple Triad, I've recreated it with a modern twist. I am constantly
working on improving the user experience, adding new features, and increasing
replayability. Get ready for exciting updates coming soon!

In its current iteration, the user journey begins with creating an account,
followed by an interactive onboarding process that covers the fundamental
aspects of the application. Users can then engage in battles against AI
opponents, progressively unlocking more challenging adversaries as they level
up. The opponents become increasingly more difficult, providing greater rewards
and a heightened sense of achievement. By collecting these rewards and advancing
in levels, users expand their arsenal of cards, enhancing their strategic
capabilities and tactical options. This progression system empowers users to
continuously improve their skills and explore new possibilities within the
application.
